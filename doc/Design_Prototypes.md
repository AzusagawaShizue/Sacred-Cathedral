# Design Prototypes: Visual Style Options

Based on the "Baroque Surrealism" and "Sacred" keywords, here are three distinct visual directions for the UI.

## Option A: "Deep Void" (Dark Mode Focused)
*   **Concept**: Emphasizes the "Deep Midnight Blue" and "Space" aspects. The UI feels like it's floating in a dark, infinite cathedral.
*   **Key Colors**:
    *   Background: `#050510` (Darker than Midnight Blue)
    *   Primary: `#D4AF37` (Gold) for borders/highlights only.
    *   Text: `#E2E5EC` (Silver Gray) for high readability.
*   **Visuals**: Heavy use of "Glow" effects, neon-like gold lines, and deep shadows.
*   **Pros**: Very immersive, reduces eye strain, fits the "Mystery" vibe.

## Option B: "Divine Light" (Light/Ethereal Mode)
*   **Concept**: Focuses on "Ivory White", "Cream", and "Gold". Represents the "Heavenly" and "Pure" side of the theme.
*   **Key Colors**:
    *   Background: `#FAF7F0` (Ivory White) with marble textures.
    *   Primary: `#1E2A5A` (Cathedral Blue) for text and strong contrast.
    *   Accents: `#D4AF37` (Gold) for soft gradients.
*   **Visuals**: Soft shadows (neumorphism-inspired but flatter), paper/parchment textures, clean lines.
*   **Pros**: Feels clean, "Holy", and readable. Closer to a traditional "App" feel.

## Option C: "Baroque Oil" (Texture Heavy)
*   **Concept**: Directly mimics the "Impasto Oil Painting" style. UI elements look like physical painted canvas or heavy gold artifacts.
*   **Key Colors**:
    *   Background: Dynamic (Image-based or complex gradients).
    *   UI Elements: Semi-transparent dark glass with heavy gold frames.
*   **Visuals**: Texture overlays (canvas, cracks), skeuomorphic buttons (looking like real gems/stones), complex borders.
*   **Pros**: Most unique and true to the "Midjourney" artistic direction. High visual impact.

## Recommendation
**Hybrid Approach (Option C + A):**
Use **Option A (Dark)** as the default base for the "Void" atmosphere, but incorporate **Option C's textures** for the key interactive elements (The Target, Buttons, Modal Frames) to create the "Oil Painting" feel without making the text unreadable.
